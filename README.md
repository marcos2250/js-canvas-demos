# simple-car-physics

Simple car 2d physics javascript demos, with canvas graphics and using the fewer lines of code as possible.

Use keyboard arrows to drive, space to handbrake.

This is not intended to be a real physics full featured simulation!

* Example 01 - Slipless, calculates low speed cornering trajectory using Ackerman turn rate;
* Example 02 - Basic slip, minimal 2-wheel model with angular inertia and wheel slide drag;
* Example 03 - Little more detailed tire slip forces using Pacejka-like lookup tables.
